# Stack- 
- stack is a linear list data structure where the insertion and deletion are allowed in one end, Called top of the stack which points the top most element of the stack. We can insert the element through the top pointer and also delete from the top pointer.
The insertion operation in stack is known as ***PUSH*** & delete operation is known as ***POP***. Before pushing any element, we must check whethere there is a space in the stack or not. If there is not enough space the stack is said to be **Overflow** condition & the new element can not be pushed in this schenerio. If we want to perfeom the pop operation & check that the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty , the stack is said to be **Underflow** condition.
We can see that the element which is pushed / inserted last - that element is poped out / delete from from the stack. That is the reson or this behaviour is called **LIFO** - *Last in first out* data structure.
