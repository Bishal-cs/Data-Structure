# Queue ---
 - Queue is a type of data structure that follows **First In First Out(FIFO)** principle. That Means element which will added first in the *queue*, will be deleted first. Queue has two ends - **"Front" & "Rear"**. Through *Front* end the data element can be deleted. Through *Rear* end data element can be inserted to the *Queue*.

 In Queue, insert operation is known as *Enqueue* operation. Delete operation is known as *Dequeue* operation. If the insert operation is attempted & there is not enough space in the queue, The section is called *Queue overflow*
