# Queue ---
 - Queue is a type of data structure that follows **First In First Out(FIFO)** principle. That Means element which will added first in the *queue*, will be deleted first. Queue has two ends - **"Front" & "Rear"**. Through *Front* end the data element can be deleted. Through *Rear* end data element can be inserted to the *Queue*.

 In Queue, insert operation is known as ***Enqueue*** operation. Delete operation is known as ***Dequeue*** operation. If the insert operation is attempted & there is not enough space in the queue, The situation is called *Queue overflow* & the new element can not be inserted here id queue is empty & delete operation attempted the sitution is called *Queue underflow*.

## Common applications in Queue ->
1. In Operating System we can use queue for cpu scheduling, managing print jobs and handeling inturrepts.
2. In data processing system we can excute task in specific order using Queue.
3. In BFS Algorithm queue is used.

### Types of Queue :
1. Linear Queue(Using array & Linked List)
2. Circular Queue
3. Double Ended Queue(Deque)
4. Prority Queue
