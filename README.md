# My DSA Concepts in C

---

## Welcome!

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using the **C programming language**. Here, you'll find my personal notes, code implementations, and problem-solving approaches for various DSA topics.

## Introduction

As I delve deeper into the world of Data Structures and Algorithms, I'm using this repository as a comprehensive resource to:

* **Document** my understanding of core DSA concepts.
* **Implement** common data structures and algorithms from scratch in C.
* **Practice** problem-solving by applying DSA principles.
* **Refer back** to concepts as needed for future learning and projects.

## Topics Covered

This section will be updated as I progress. Here's an overview of the DSA topics I plan to cover (or have already started covering):

### **Basic Concepts**
* Time and Space Complexity Analysis
* Pointers
* Recursion

### **Data Structures**
* Arrays
* Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees - *future*)
* Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
* Hash Tables

### **Algorithms**
* Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort)
* Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
* Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall - *future*)
* Dynamic Programming (*future*)
* Greedy Algorithms (*future*)

## How to Use This Repository

Each DSA topic will typically have its own directory. Inside each directory, you can expect to find:

* C source code files (`.c`) for implementations.
* Header files (`.h`) if applicable.
* Possibly a `notes.md` or similar file with detailed explanations of the concepts.
* A `main.c` or `test.c` for example usage and testing.

To compile and run the C code, you'll generally use a C compiler like GCC:

```bash
# Navigate into a specific topic directory, e.g., 'linked_lists'
cd linked_lists

# Compile a C file
gcc your_file.c -o your_program

# Run the compiled program
./your_program
